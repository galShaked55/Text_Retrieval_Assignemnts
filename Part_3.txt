1. 'the', 'of', 'in', 'a', 'and', 'to', 'for', 'said', 'on', 'that'

2. 'memphia', 'platinumhaired', 'platinumsellers', 'fiverecord', 'conomination', 'specifially', 'indescretion', 'phofo', 'whitewigged', 'metroiii'

3. The different charactersistics of the above 2 sets:
    - The high frequency set contains stop words/function words with low semantic value. 
    - The lowest frequency set seem to contain errors (like 'phopo' instead of 'photo'), or compound words - terms that combines two distinct words (like 'platinumhaired', 'platinumsellers'). 

4. The 2 terms are:  'platinumhaired', 'platinumsellers'
The high frequency set contains stop words/function words with low semantic value.
The lowest frequency set seems to contain errors (like 'phopo' instead of 'photo') or compound words - terms that combine two distinct words (like 'platinumhaired', 'platinumsellers').

4. The 2 terms are: 'platinumhaired', 'platinumsellers'
Both of these terms were also in the top 10 lowest term frequency, meaning they both appear only in one document -doc ID: 'AP880222-0003'.
These compound words appear in a document written in an artistic style characterized by unconventional vocabulary and extensive use of compound word formations.
Our idea was was that documents containing such rare terms would likely contain additional rare terms. For example: 
documents with numerous spelling errors naturally generate many unique terms, or documents written in distinctive stylistic voices employ unusual vocabulary.
So we took the set of lowest frequency terms and looked at the doc IDs. We found out that 4 terms from this set are actually from the same document:
1. 'platinumhaired' - appears in 1 document(s)
    Documents: ['AP880222-0003']
2. 'platinumsellers' - appears in 1 document(s)
    Documents: ['AP880222-0003']
3. 'fiverecord' - appears in 1 document(s)
    Documents: ['AP880222-0003']
4. 'conomination' - appears in 1 document(s)
    Documents: ['AP880222-0003']
